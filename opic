4. RESTAURANT
Describe one of your favorite restaurants where you often go to eat. What type of food do they serve there? What do you like about that restaurant?
Rather than the restaurant I usually go to, the one where I had a great meal is Cham Hanwoo Sogalbijip. 
This restaurant stands out to me because I believe their beef is superior to that of other beef restaurants. 
They serve raw beef ribs, marinated beef ribs, and beef rice soup. It's best to order the raw beef ribs there; 
they are more delicious than those at other places.

Tell me a little bit about yourself and what you do for a living
I’m a student currently studying algorithms to find a job. I’m a third-year college student, but since I’m 31 years old, 
I want to get a job before I graduate. I am also studying English to improve my job prospects. 
I have studied English for a total of about 4 years. I continued to study English steadily while I was in the military. 
Fortunately, I have reached a level where I can find and work on methods to study and express my thoughts in English to some extent.
Even more fortunately, ChatGPT was launched, and I’ve been using it well for studying recently. It really helps me clear up any questions that come to mind. 
Today, I studied algorithms as usual. I reviewed BFS_basics and learned dynamic programming. 
I realized I needed to understand dynamic programming when I revisited the 10th problem on LeetCode, which I had previously thought, "I'll tackle it next time."
I woke up at 8:00 a.m. today and retrieved my phone from the duty officer’s room. 
I spent about an hour chatting with ChatGPT and working on my English. I also managed to squat 90 kg for 15 reps and 5 sets, and bench press 60 kg for 15 reps and 5 sets. 
I think that growth is exciting and enjoyable, much more so than making me forget the pain related to parting.
I want to attain a genuine sense of ease and happiness, where I can smile at any time. 
While I’ve been weak and unable to be completely candid, I’m learning and growing through these experiences.
I'll just write the next thought and cut down my words, hoping that my thinking skills will strengthen and my response time will improve when I face unexpected situations.
I’ve reached a certain level of English proficiency, and now I can see a bit of my future path. 
I want to live with a smile, becoming a relaxed and content person. 
I wonder how it would have been if I had been more relaxed before my military service, since there are so many different people living here.
I feel somewhat disconnected, possibly because I’m not in my 30s yet. 
It seems like I’m alone in a vast ocean. so I can only see distant things from afar. I wonder how things will turn out once I go to university and start working.
I wasted about 20 minutes eating. Recently, I’ve been maintaining my weight around 70 kg.
the end time is 11:02pm.

I’d like to talk about where you live. Describe your house to me. What does it look like? Where is it located?
I’ve lived in Mandeok, Busan. This neighborhood is in a mountainous area, so there is a fresh smell of leaves in the air, especially after it rains. 
I live in a row house on the second floor. The first floor is used as a private institute and a beauty shop. 
There are an elementary school and a middle school in our neighborhood, and my house is located about halfway between them. 
My house is built with a traditional Korean tile roof, as it was constructed a long time ago. 
A small to medium-sized mart and a bakery are nearby, and I often visit them. There’s also a coin laundry and a Korean traditional hospital around. 
It has everything I need. The subway is about a 10-minute walk from my house. From what I’ve heard and think, my house used to be quite expensive. 
The value is determined by people. I’ve heard that BTS’s Jungkook used to live in this neighborhood or something.
I heard that BTS's Jungkook lived in this neighborhood until 2nd grade in elementary school, or something like that.

나는 부산 만덕동에서 살아왔어. 이 지역은 산동네야. 그래서 공기 중에 나뭇잎냄새가 많이 나. 특히 비온뒤에. 난 연립주택 이층에 살고 있어. 
첫 층은 학원과 뷰티샵으로 쓰여지고 있어. 거기 초등학교와 중학교가 있는데 우리집은 그 중간 즘에 위치해 있어. 
우리집은 옛날 한옥집처럼 한국식 기와로 지어졌어 왜냐면 이건 오래전에 지어진 집이거든. 중소규모의 마트와 빵집이 우리집 근처에 있어. 
난 종종 거길 이용하곤해. 그리고 코인세탁소가 있고 한의원도 우리집 근처에 있네. 있을 건 다 있네. 그리고 지하철이 우리집 근처에 걸어서 10분 거리정도에 있어. 
내가 듣기로는 그리고 생각하기로는 우리집이 옛날엔 비쌌던 거 같애. 가치는 사람이 만들어가는거겠지.. bts 정국이 이동네에 초2까지 살았었다나 뭐라나..

What things do you usually do on the weekend? Do you watch TV? Do you catch up on sleep? What else do you do on the weekend?
Because my computer crashed, everything I wrote got lost. The computers on either side of mine experienced the same issue. I had written quite a bit..
If I think and write it again, it will be more elaborate..

컴퓨터 다운 걸려서 쓴거 다 날아갔어. 양 옆에도 같은 문제를 겪었어. 꽤 많이 썼었는데.. 
한 번 더 쓰면, 더 정교해지겠지..
The end time, considering the distractions like listening to music, was 00:31 on August 31, 2024.

Continuing from yesterday topic
It starts at 22:10 on August 31, 2024.
What things do you usually do on the weekend? Do you watch TV? Do you catch up on sleep? What else do you do on the weekend?
 Recently, I've been studying algorithms for about a month. 
Due to the military training period, I work until 20:00 even on weekends so I'm too tired to study these matters. 
So, I were just going to sleep. But that's different story.
 To get to the point, I study algorithms whether it's the weekend or a weekday. 
I've finally decided on a career path, considering options like software engineering, the Korean SAT, semiconductor engineering, and so on. 
The reason I chose this path is that it offers the potential to earn money quickly, which fits my needs. 
Additionally, it only requires study skills, so I believe it's worth the challenge. 
Most of all, this path will help me improve my thinking skills through sustained work and thought. 
I wanted to learn abacus for cognitive skills, so I think the CS path could serve as a substitute. 
Plus, it has the potential for good earnings. Moreover, the fact that it only requires working with a laptop, without spatial limitations, suits me well. 
In any case, this is what I wanted to learn and what I will learn. If my ability reach, I can achieve anything..

 최근에 난 알고리즘을 약 한달전부터 공부하고 있어. 왜냐면 훈련기간이라 주말에도 20:00까지 일을해서 이걸 공부하기에는 피곤해. 그래서 난 그냥 잤어. 뭐.. 이건 별개의 애기고.
 본론으로 들어가면, 난 주말이든 평일이든 알고리즘 공부를 하고있어. 마침내 소프트웨어 엔지니어와 수능, 반도체 엔지니어 등등 중에서 진로를 결정했거든. 내가 왜 이 길을 택했냐면, 
돈을 빨리 벌수 있거든. 이게 내 요구사항에 부합해. 왜냐면 이건 그냥 공부능력이 요구되거든, 그래서 이건 도전할 가치가 있다고 생각해. 
무엇보다도 이길은 일과 생각을 함으로써 내 사고력을 향상시켜줄거야. 난 사고력을 위해 주산이 배우고 싶었어. 그래서 cs 길이 이걸 대체해줄수있을거같애. 
또한 돈도 괜찮게 벌잖아. 게다가 단지 노트북만으로 공간의 제약없이 일한다는 사실이 내맘에 들어. 어차피 내가 배우고 싶었고 배울거였어. 만약 내 능력이 닿는다면, 뭐든 이뤄낼수있겠지..
