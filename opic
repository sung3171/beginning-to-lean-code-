4. RESTAURANT
Describe one of your favorite restaurants where you often go to eat. What type of food do they serve there? What do you like about that restaurant?
Rather than the restaurant I usually go to, the one where I had a great meal is Cham Hanwoo Sogalbijip. 
This restaurant stands out to me because I believe their beef is superior to that of other beef restaurants. 
They serve raw beef ribs, marinated beef ribs, and beef rice soup. It's best to order the raw beef ribs there; 
they are more delicious than those at other places.

Tell me a little bit about yourself and what you do for a living
I’m a student currently studying algorithms to find a job. I’m a third-year college student, but since I’m 31 years old, 
I want to get a job before I graduate. I am also studying English to improve my job prospects. 
I have studied English for a total of about 4 years. I continued to study English steadily while I was in the military. 
Fortunately, I have reached a level where I can find and work on methods to study and express my thoughts in English to some extent.
Even more fortunately, ChatGPT was launched, and I’ve been using it well for studying recently. It really helps me clear up any questions that come to mind. 
Today, I studied algorithms as usual. I reviewed BFS_basics and learned dynamic programming. 
I realized I needed to understand dynamic programming when I revisited the 10th problem on LeetCode, which I had previously thought, "I'll tackle it next time."
I woke up at 8:00 a.m. today and retrieved my phone from the duty officer’s room. 
I spent about an hour chatting with ChatGPT and working on my English. I also managed to squat 90 kg for 15 reps and 5 sets, and bench press 60 kg for 15 reps and 5 sets. 
I think that growth is exciting and enjoyable, much more so than making me forget the pain related to parting.
I want to attain a genuine sense of ease and happiness, where I can smile at any time. 
While I’ve been weak and unable to be completely candid, I’m learning and growing through these experiences.
I'll just write the next thought and cut down my words, hoping that my thinking skills will strengthen and my response time will improve when I face unexpected situations.
I’ve reached a certain level of English proficiency, and now I can see a bit of my future path. 
I want to live with a smile, becoming a relaxed and content person. 
I wonder how it would have been if I had been more relaxed before my military service, since there are so many different people living here.
I feel somewhat disconnected, possibly because I’m not in my 30s yet. 
It seems like I’m alone in a vast ocean. so I can only see distant things from afar. I wonder how things will turn out once I go to university and start working.
I wasted about 20 minutes eating. Recently, I’ve been maintaining my weight around 70 kg.
the end time is 11:02pm.


Today's start time is 11:02 PM on August 28, 2024. 
I’d like to talk about where you live. Describe your house to me. What does it look like? Where is it located?
I’ve lived in Mandeok, Busan. This neighborhood is in a mountainous area, so there is a fresh smell of leaves in the air, especially after it rains. 
I live in a row house on the second floor. The first floor is used as a private institute and a beauty shop. 
There are an elementary school and a middle school in our neighborhood, and my house is located about halfway between them. 
My house is built with a traditional Korean tile roof, as it was constructed a long time ago. 
A small to medium-sized mart and a bakery are nearby, and I often visit them. There’s also a coin laundry and a Korean traditional hospital around. 
It has everything I need. The subway is about a 10-minute walk from my house. From what I’ve heard and think, my house used to be quite expensive. 
The value is determined by people. I’ve heard that BTS’s Jungkook used to live in this neighborhood or something.
I heard that BTS's Jungkook lived in this neighborhood until 2nd grade in elementary school, or something like that.

나는 부산 만덕동에서 살아왔어. 이 지역은 산동네야. 그래서 공기 중에 나뭇잎냄새가 많이 나. 특히 비온뒤에. 난 연립주택 이층에 살고 있어. 
첫 층은 학원과 뷰티샵으로 쓰여지고 있어. 거기 초등학교와 중학교가 있는데 우리집은 그 중간 즘에 위치해 있어. 
우리집은 옛날 한옥집처럼 한국식 기와로 지어졌어 왜냐면 이건 오래전에 지어진 집이거든. 중소규모의 마트와 빵집이 우리집 근처에 있어. 
난 종종 거길 이용하곤해. 그리고 코인세탁소가 있고 한의원도 우리집 근처에 있네. 있을 건 다 있네. 그리고 지하철이 우리집 근처에 걸어서 10분 거리정도에 있어. 
내가 듣기로는 그리고 생각하기로는 우리집이 옛날엔 비쌌던 거 같애. 가치는 사람이 만들어가는거겠지.. bts 정국이 이동네에 초2까지 살았었다나 뭐라나..

What things do you usually do on the weekend? Do you watch TV? Do you catch up on sleep? What else do you do on the weekend?
Because my computer crashed, everything I wrote got lost. The computers on either side of mine experienced the same issue. I had written quite a bit..
If I think and write it again, it will be more elaborate..

컴퓨터 다운 걸려서 쓴거 다 날아갔어. 양 옆에도 같은 문제를 겪었어. 꽤 많이 썼었는데.. 
한 번 더 쓰면, 더 정교해지겠지..
The end time, considering the distractions like listening to music, was 00:31 on August 31, 2024.

Continuing from yesterday topic
It starts at 22:10 on August 31, 2024.
What things do you usually do on the weekend? Do you watch TV? Do you catch up on sleep? What else do you do on the weekend?
 Recently, I've been studying algorithms for about a month. 
Due to the military training period, I work until 20:00 even on weekends so I'm too tired to study these matters. 
So, I were just going to sleep. But that's different story.
 To get to the point, I study algorithms whether it's the weekend or a weekday. 
I've finally decided on a career path, considering options like software engineering, the Korean SAT, semiconductor engineering, and so on. 
The reason I chose this path is that it offers the potential to earn money quickly, which fits my needs. 
Additionally, it only requires study skills, so I believe it's worth the challenge. 
Most of all, this path will help me improve my thinking skills through sustained work and thought. 
I wanted to learn abacus for cognitive skills, so I think the CS path could serve as a substitute. 
Plus, it has the potential for good earnings. Moreover, the fact that it only requires working with a laptop, without spatial limitations, suits me well. 
In any case, this is what I wanted to learn and what I will learn. If my ability reach, I can achieve anything..

 최근에 난 알고리즘을 약 한달전부터 공부하고 있어. 왜냐면 훈련기간이라 주말에도 20:00까지 일을해서 이걸 공부하기에는 피곤해. 그래서 난 그냥 잤어. 뭐.. 이건 별개의 애기고.
 본론으로 들어가면, 난 주말이든 평일이든 알고리즘 공부를 하고있어. 마침내 소프트웨어 엔지니어와 수능, 반도체 엔지니어 등등 중에서 진로를 결정했거든. 내가 왜 이 길을 택했냐면, 
돈을 빨리 벌수 있거든. 이게 내 요구사항에 부합해. 왜냐면 이건 그냥 공부능력이 요구되거든, 그래서 이건 도전할 가치가 있다고 생각해. 
무엇보다도 이길은 일과 생각을 함으로써 내 사고력을 향상시켜줄거야. 난 사고력을 위해 주산이 배우고 싶었어. 그래서 cs 길이 이걸 대체해줄수있을거같애. 
또한 돈도 괜찮게 벌잖아. 게다가 단지 노트북만으로 공간의 제약없이 일한다는 사실이 내맘에 들어. 어차피 내가 배우고 싶었고 배울거였어. 만약 내 능력이 닿는다면, 뭐든 이뤄낼수있겠지..

 I would like to know how you learned to use a certain skill or technology. 
Who was it that taught you? How did you learn it? Tell me all the things you had to do to learn how to use that skill or technology.
Today, I wanted to go to bed early because I've been feeling uneasy for no clear reason since this morning, 
and watching NeetCode's videos made me think again about the uncertain future in IT. 
However, my laundry isn’t finished because the hot water setting isn’t working, so I had to wait an additional 50 minutes and came back here.
 I watched a recent NeetCode video where the host was fired from Google and hasn’t found a new job yet. 
It looks like the hiring freeze is still ongoing. Watching the video made me feel pressured, thinking, 'Could even someone like him get fired?',
plus, when facing and evaluating LeetCode problems compared to my study experience, It felt too distant. 
But I I boosted myself with the thought, 'If I can’t do it, who can?'. The laundry should be done. Tonight, I’ll go to bed early.
End time: 23:18 on September 1, 2024

 오늘 일찍 자려고 했어. 왜냐면 아침부터 뭔지모르게 불안했고 미래에 대한 불안을 니트코드를 보며 한번더 생각해보게 되었거든.
그런데 빨래가 안 끝났어, 왜냐면 온수설정이 작동을 안해, 그래서 50분 더 기다려야해서 여기 다시 왔어.
 난 최근 니트코드 유튜브 영상을 봤어. 그 사람은 구글에서 해고당했고 아직 직업을 못 구한 상태야. 
정말 취업난이 진행 중이긴 한가봐. 유튜브를 볼떄, 난 압박감을 느꼈어. 저런사람이 잘려? 
그리고 리트코드 문제에 직면하고 가늠해봤을 때 그리고 내 공부 경험에 빗대어 봤을 때, 이건 아득해 보였어. 
그러나 내가아니면 누가할까 라는 생각으로 기운을 냈었어. 빨래 다 됬겠다, 오늘은 일찍 자야지.

It's 00:00? on September 3, 2024
 Today, I don’t have much time, so I'll briefly write what happened. 
This evening, I went to the gym and did squats with 90 kg for 6 sets of 15 reps. 
During the rest periods, I also worked on overhead presses and two-arm dumbbell curls. 
Later, I did squats with 100 kg on the Smith machine for 3 sets of 15 reps (because other person were using the rack). 
It feels good to go study during break time after working out, as I can rest while studying.
I felt this way at that time. From 18:26 to about 19:45, so it seems like I was there for roughly that amount of time.
 I said I would write soon, but I'm late again. I’m finishing up and going to bed.
The end time is 00:56 on Sempember 3, 2024

 오늘은 시간이 없으니 간단히 오늘 일을 써야지. 오늘 저녁 난 체육관을 가서 스쿼트를 90kg 6세트 15회 그리고 남는시간에 오버헤드 프레스와 양손덤벨컬을했어. 
그리고 다음 100kg 스쿼트를 스미스머신으로 3세트 15회 했어(왜냐면 다른 사람이 랙을 쓰고있었거든.). 
운동 후 쉴시간이 필요할때 공부하러 가고 공부하면서 쉴수있다는게 좋은거같애. 
그때는 그렇게 느꼈어. 18:26부터 약19:45? 내 느낌에 그정도즘 머물렀던거같애.
 빨리 쓴다는게 또 늦었네. 그만하고 자야지. 


It’s 10:04 PM on September 4, 2024. 
 I had a thought that the end of my English study is near.
As I was walking up the stairs to go to another room for the night roll call, I felt a vague sense of futility. 
The thought that started to emerge was that I am beginning to see things I couldn’t see before. 
Over the past month, I think I’ve achieved rapid growth thanks to ChatGPT. It has answered everything I wanted to know, including details 
I couldn’t ask a tutor without bothering them, or that even Google couldn’t help me with. 
In a way, my English studies might come to an end, similar to how I no longer study Korean. Or perhaps I might start a deeper level of study. 
 I think I should create a separate space for recording my workouts. 
Today, I did bench presses with 60kg for 15 reps, 3 sets; lat pulldowns with 35kg for 15 reps, 4 sets; then took a break and 
did bench presses with 60kg for 15 reps, 2 sets; assisted chin-ups on a machine with 35kg for 15 reps, 1 set; 
bench presses with the Smith machine with 60kg for 15 reps, 3 sets; dumbbell chest-supported rows with 19kg for 15 reps, 3 sets;
ench presses with the Smith machine with 60kg for 15 reps, 2 sets; and bent-over rows with the Smith machine with 60kg for 15 reps, 4 sets and overheadpress 20kg*1*1 
and two-arm dumbbell curl 9kg*20*1.
The sequence might be incorrect, but I did it.
 My english still quite far away. Even those piecemeal above thoughts might have been getting ahead of myself.
 I want to be candid. I don't want to embellish or cover up my words anymore.

 드디어, 영어공부의 끝이 보인다는 생각이 한 번 나왔어. 오늘 밤 점호를 위해 다른방을 가기위해 계단을 오르며, 내 마음속에서 '허무하다.'라는 단어가 아닌 느낌이 들었어. 
이제 '내가 보지못하던것이 보이기 시작했어.' 라는 생각이 들기 시작했어. 이번 한달 동안 내생각에 가장 빠른 성장을 챗지피티 덕분에 이루었어. 
지피티는 내가 원하는 모든것을 답변해주었고, 튜터를 성가시게 만들까봐 내 마음속에 묵혀뒀던, 다음을 추구하지 못했던, 사라졌던, 심지어 구글링도 이루지 못했던 자세한 것을 답변해주었어. 
말그대로, 영어공부도 한국어 공부를 따로 하지 않는것처럼 끝이 나겠지. 아니면 약간더 깊은 공부를 시작할지도 몰라. . 
 내 생각에 운동기록 공간을 따로 만들어야겠어. 오늘 나는 벤치프레스 60kg*15*3 랫풀다운 35kg*15*4 쉬고 벤치프레스 60kg*15*2 어시스트 친업머신 35kg*15*1 
스미스머신 벤치프레스 60kg*15*3 덤벨체스트서포티드로우 19kg*15*3 스미스머신 벤치프레스 60kg*15*2 스미스머신 벤트로우 60kg*15*4 오버헤드프레스 20kg*1*1 양손덤벨컬9kg*20*1.
순서가 틀릴수 있지만 했어.
 영어가 여전히 아직 멀었네. 위에 단편적 생각마저도 설레발이었나봐.
 난 솔직해지고싶어. 더 이상 말을 꾸미거나 숨기지 않을래.


It’s 22:23 on September 8, 2024. 
Today, I studied coding on Programmers. I think it will be a long way to achieve my goals. 
Now it feels like my reading speed in Korean has slowed down compared to before. My English isn’t great, and my Korean isn’t great either. Man, what on earth what a mess.
I imagine one path might be pursuing a PhD in computer science related to medicine, like AlphaFold, and then going to medical school. 
It’s exciting to think about discovering something with AI and working with drugs. I’ve only dreamed about it once. It’s always been a thought in my mind.
Come to think of it, getting a job in the bio field seems challenging. 

I remembered what my brother told me the day before yesterday. 
he suggested that I might consider law school instead, which takes 3 years. Reflecting on it, I realize these are milestones. 
I’ve also thought about getting a job and then having a girlfriend to spend time with. It also seems like the time is coming to meet my friends. 
I’m happy to see my growth in some areas. I’m not sure what the future holds, maybe I’m just expressing my own feelings. 
End time: 00:15 on September 9, 2024
오늘, 나는 프로그래머스로 코딩을 해봤어. 내생각에 이건 이루기에 엄청 오래걸릴듯해.
이제 한글이 예전보다 좀 느리게 읽히는 감이 있는듯해. 영어도 별로고 한국어도 별로고 세상에 엉망이네.
난 한가지를 상상해봤는데 알파폴드처럼 의학 관련되게 cs 박사 까지 가고 의대가는거야.
무언가를 ai로 찾고 약물을 다룬다는게 재밌겠어. 뭐그냥 한번 꿈꿔봤어. 언제나 그랬듯. 
그러고보니 바이오 쪽은 취업이 잘 안될텐데말야.

엊그제 형이 한말이 생각이 나. 차라리 3년 걸리는 로스쿨에 가라고. 되새겨 보면 이런건 지표들이거든.
난 취직하고 여자친구를 만들어 같이 놀러다니며 시간을 보낼 생각도 해보곤있어. 그리고 친구들을 만나야할 시기도 온 듯해.
이렇게까지 성장한 건 기쁘네. 어떻게 될지 또 모르는데 그냥 내 기분만 내는거려나. 


It's 22:38 on September 9, 2024.
Certainly, I should write down what I want to express right when I’m feeling it, because if I wait, my thoughts from yesterday will fade away completely.
So, I need to commit to today.
Today, my mind is peaceful. I'm not sure if it's because I'm too lazy to think or if I'm simply comforted. Anyway, emotional thoughts aren't coming to me.
Today, I did squats with 100 kg for 10 reps and 10 sets. My current weight is around 71~72 kg.
I'm also enjoying working on programming from scratch, starting at level 0.
Additionally, my SIM card isn't working today, so I need to sort that out. 
I'm also looking into buying a new smartphone and am considering the iPhone 15 Pro. 
I like the call recording feature, the shortcut key for recording, and the 6.1-inch size. 
It’s a bit smaller compared to my Galaxy Note 9, which has a 6.4-inch screen. 
I think a larger size is better for studying, while a smaller size is more convenient for casual use.
I’m considering recording my personal growth to avoid any suspicions about my absence. Somehow, it ended up like this.
But it will be great. I also want to be an inspiration to others, like people who have inspired me. Someday, I hope to be a valued member of society. 
I haven’t done so yet because I feel like I’m not at a level where I can write something meaningful. But recording my growth is something I can do. 
I think my thoughts just haven't reached that point yet.

I walked around, muttering in English from near the dormitory to a distant placet to feel free... 
To what extent should I be candid? If I’m too honest, I might end up hurting others or myself. 
Even though I want to lighten my burdens, when my roommate? asked, "Are you out walking?" I hesitated for a moment. Maybe it wasn’t noticeable.
I think that handsome people seem to come to me easily, wherever I am. Is it because of shared experiences?
I only focused straight ahead. It was only after being beaten that I realized my mistake. 
It seems I want something to make me smile like I did before. When I see others who aren’t smiling, I view it from a different perspective. I reflect on it.
I didn’t realize this before because I thought not checking my appearance was a virtue. Well, That’s good.
I used to think the mind is important, but now I realize that behavior follows the mind.
It feels like the joy of smiling has returned to me, something I had forgotten. It feels like I've just written anything.

확실히 쓰고싶은건 내 느낌이 표현하고싶을때 바로 그때 써야지. 어제쓰고싶다고한건 머리에서 다날아갔네.
그래, 그렇다면 오늘에 충실해야지.
오늘따라, 마음이 평안하네. 그냥 생각하기 귀찮은걸까 편안한걸까. 아무튼 감정적 생각이 안떠오르네.
오늘, 난 스쿼트 100kg 10개 10세트를 했어. 그리고 최근 몸무게는 71kg~72kg 왔다갔다해.
그리고 난 프로그래머스를 처음부터인 0레벨을 즐겁게하고있어.
그리고 오늘 내 유심이 맛이 갔어. 그래서 이것도 처리할 예정이야. 난 스마트폰 뭐살까 찾고 고민하고 있어.
내생각에 아이폰15프로 살거같애. 통화녹음,녹음단축키,사이즈 6.1인치. 이건 갤럭시 노트9 6.4인치에 비해 약간 작아. 
내생각에 크기가 크면 공부하기좋고 크기가 작으면 놀러다니기 좋은거같애.
난 공백에대한 사람들의 의심을 피하기위해 내성장을 기록할 생각도 있어.  어쩌다보니 이렇게 됬네..
그러나 이건 좋을거야. 나도 내게 자극을 줬던사람들처럼 자극을 주고싶었어. 언젠가 사회구성원의 일부로서 그런사람이 되고싶었어.
그러나 무언가를 글 쓸 수준이 안되서 못했었어. 그러나 성장기록이란게 있잖아.  내생각에 그 생각이 여태 미치지 못했던건가봐.

생활관 근처부터 저멀리까지 영어로 혼잣말하며 걸어다녔어. 기분이 자유로워지기위해.. 어느정도까지 솔직해져야하는걸까. 너무가벼우면 다른사람들 혹은 우선적 나에게 상처를 주잖아.
비록 무거움을 던져버리고 싶다해도말이야. 룸메이트?가 '밖에 돌아다녔어요?'물어봤어. 조금 머뭇거렸었어. 아마도? 티안났을거야. 
내생각에 잘생긴사람은 내게 쉽게 다가오는거같아. 어디든지. 경험이비슷해선가.
나는 내앞만보고있었어. 맞고난후에야 정신차릴수있었어. 난 이게 잘못됬다고 인지해. 난 이전처럼 웃을수있는 무언가를 원하는거같애. 그리고 웃지않는다른사람을 볼때. 
다른관점이보여 내가저렇게 보였구나. 반성해. 난 이전엔 전혀 몰랐어. 왜냐면 내생각에 내 외면을 체크안하는게 미덕인줄 알았거든. 잘됐지 뭐.
마음이중요하지라고생각했는데 생각해보니 마음다음이 행동이네.
잊고있었던 웃음이 돌아온거같아! 정말 아무말이나 쓰는거 같네!

 My brother and mom want to go abroad with me recently. Last day with sister-in-law they want to go Daeman. 
When I in military service, mostly other soldier plan to go abroad. there is something.  
My cousin is also getting married next year to his girlfriend, whom he met at either a church or a cathedral (I'm not sure which). 
These Chuseok It seems they need to meet.. 
the Sanjun bought a apartment next to Lcity with Infant laon. why loan eventhough he marrige with china whealthy girlfreind 
 The end of these years I plan to work at private institute. Looking child is joy and I can refresh. 
 Something.. I want to be a productive man.. I have a pressure with study, which I set aside a little but still I have, 
money first I have to think and my social network which how could I solve in the future. 
What life I am going to live.. 
The live I feel happy to buy a Iphone or studying hard for self-actualization or gaining laugh piece from social network. 
I also think Money should be tool, I never lost something from it. So you should be grow if you face situation to need big wealth. 
I can't remeber image that money is just tool in the such internet capture. 
when you chase the self-actualization, It seems you lose your live meaning from world you live with people. 
It seems like the flow reflected to me when I heard from my brother said his brother who went to stanford but not complete and wander. 
 even then I heard the story like someone who is department store vip, The think in my part of competition node up.  
 The reason the writting took so long to finish is because I kept getting distracted in between.

형과 엄마가 요즘따라 나하고 해외여행을 가고싶어해. 저번에 형수님하고 있을때도 같이 대만가자던데. 내가 군대에있을때, 대부분 애들이 해외여행을 계획하기도했어. 뭐가있나봐.
 사촌형도 내년이면 (잘모르지만) 교횐가 성당인가에서 사귄 여친이랑 결혼한데. 추석 때 같이 보자는 거 같던데. 상준이형도 뭐 엘시티 옆에 아파트 신생아대출끼고 샀다나.. 중국부자여친있는데 왠 대출? 
 이번년도말에 학원에서 일할생각인데. 애들보는게 웃기기도하고 리프레시할수있기도해서야. 
 뭔가.. 생산적인 사람이 되고싶은데.. 약간 놓았지만 아직 존재하는 공부에대한 압박감과 우선적으로 생각해야할 돈 그리고 앞으로 풀어가야할 인간관계에 대한 압박이 있어. 
어떤삶을살아갈까.. 아이폰을 사는것만으로도 행복한 삶 또는 자아실현을위한공부하는삶 또는 인간관계에서의 웃음조각을 얻는 삶? 
내생각에도 돈은수단이되어야지, 이것으로인해 중요한 무언가를 잃어서는안되. 그럼 큰부를 요구하는 상황을직면하면 또 성장이 강요되나. 
 인터넷캡쳐같은거에서 돈은 도구라는 서적 이미지를 봤는데 기억이 안나네. 
 자아실현을 쫓다보면 사람들과살아가는세상에서의살아가는의미를 잃을거같고 아는형 스탠포드박사과정수료못하고 서울에서 방황하는거봤다는 걸 형한테 들으면 그것도 내게 비춰진 흐름같고  
 그러다가도 백화점 vip 같은 애기 들으면 내 경쟁심리가 고개를 들고. 
 글쓰는게 늦게 끝난 이유는 중간중간마다 딴짓많이했어.

Lately, I've been focusing a bit on humor. Previously, I didn’t even consider it due to my obsession. 
Or rather, did I handle it with great caution? Anyway, I was very stingy about playing. 
Mostly, I tackled math or fact-based information, not literature. 
I had been putting off reading literature or exploring human experiences because I saw them as a form of play. 
So when I first encountered a long dialogue that mixed other people's thoughts, I was surprised.
After breaking free from my obsession, I finally remembered the childish feeling of human connection that I used to experience. 
I used to feel this way when I was with my family, but I hadn’t thought deeply about it since.
I'm planning to find some leisure. I watched the TV program 'I Am Solo' on YouTube, and it's so funny. 
It seems like they’re sacrificing a lot just to make us laugh. Big cheers to brother!

최근에 난 약간? 웃긴거에 초점이 맞춰져있어. 이전엔 내 강박으로 거들떠도안보던것이었어. 아니.. 그냥 매우 주의해서 다뤘었나? 아무튼 노는거에 매우 인색했었어. 
주로 난 수학이나 사실에기반한 정보를 다뤘었어 문학이아니라. 나는 문학이나 인간사를 보는거를 미뤘었어 왜냐면 이건 노는거라생각했거든. 
그래서 난 처음 사람의 생각을 섞은 긴 다이얼로그를 읽었을때 놀라웠어. 
 처음 강박에서 벗어난후, 난 처음으로 어릴적 공기중 인간사 느낌을 기억해봤어. 가족들과 있을때 느꼇지만 그이후로 깊게는 더이상 생각안해봤었어. 
난 여유를 찾을 계획이야. 유튜브로 '나는솔로'를 봤는데. 댕웃기더라ㄱㅜ. 행님들 한몸바쳐 웃겨주시는거같기도하고 응원함다ㅜㅋ!

 I'm studying programming, and when I see other people's solutions, there’s so much to learn. 
It seems like there’s a lot, a little, hard or easy. I wonder how much I could learn if I studied for 6 years. 
Did I learn a lot over the past 6 years? Well, it’s hard to say I learned nothing.
 I think if I had 6 years, learning music wouldn’t be a bad idea since it could eventually lead to a lot of money. 
 My English skills have improved somewhat. 
 I read ‘정도전:최후의전쟁,’ a historical faction during my military service. (After that, I read '고구려' and '기황후.)
It was the first novel I read in about 10 years. It was vividly described, almost as if it were alive.
So, I tend to think deeply rather than lightly about things. 
Anyway, it was so exciting and made me want to learn other languages to experience the culture that carves out each person’s magnificent history.
This led me to listen to J-pop. (Compared to J-pop, I feel that China, with its socialist system rather than liberalism, might not foster individual talent.) 
 I think all these experiences branched out from each other.
 It’s a feeling from that time, and it doesn’t continue all the time… lol.
 As I listen to "춘뢰", I wonder is there an overlap between talent, being marvelous, creativity, and humor?  The sentence is too we igh ty.. 
 In my opinion, the greatest song from China is Yanbian Bachelor's Song. That’s just what I’m thinking at the moment.
 How close can you get to humor?

 난 프로그래머스 공부하는중이야. 딴사람들 솔루션을보면 거기 배울게많은거같아. 
많은듯,적은듯,어려운듯,쉬운듯.. 6년동안 뭐든배우면 얼마나많이배울까. 
아니 지난 6년동안 많이 배웠던가? 음.. 없다할순없겠네.
 내생각에 만약6년이있다면, 음악을 배우는것도 나쁘지 않을거같아. 왜냐면 그건 결과적으로 많은 돈이 될거같거든. 
 내 생각에 영어 실력이 다소 상승한거 같아.
 군대에서 역사팩션 '정도전:최후의전쟁'을 읽었어. (그리고 이후에 '고구려', '기황후' 를 읽었지.)
근 10년만에 읽는 소설이었지. 이건 생생하게 이미지로 묘사했어 마치살아있는듯. 
또.. 무겁게 생각하는듯 가볍지않은. 
아무튼 이건 흥미로워서 날 다른 각 개인의 거대한 역사가 새겨진 문화를 느끼고싶어 다른 언어를 배우고싶게 만들었어. 
그래서 이건 J-pop을 듣게 이끌었어.( J-pop에 비해, 내 생각에 자유주의가 아닌 사회주의 인 중국은 각 개인의 재능을 키울 여유가 없는듯해..) 
 내 생각에 이런 모든 사건들이 가지쳐나가는거같아. 나도 딴사람을 자극해야하는데. 
 이건 그때의 느낌이고 매순 이어지지는 않아..ㅎ 
 '춘뢰' 듣다가 쓰는건데. 재능, 경이, 창의 와 웃긴게 겹칠까?  문장 무ㄱ지ㄱㅎ ㅏ다
 내 생각에 중국의 최대 명곡은 연변 총각 노래 같은데 . 내 지금 생각으로는 말이야.
 넌 얼마나 웃긴것에 가까워질수있을까.




The start time is 10:12 PM on Wednesday, September 25, 2024. 
Certainly, it's good to write when I want to. Yesterday, I wanted to write about social skills and the story of when I walked away. 
Just to write it..
But as time passed, my desire to write that story faded away.
It happened in a place that felt very low, where I had that experience. Anyhow when He came out to greet me, He said, “You will do well in social networking!”. 
He was from the 51st Division of the army, serving in the military band in the ’90s. 
He looked like an artist; I thought he resembled 최민수, the celebrity, especially with the alcohol bottles in front of him. 
Among conversations, he mentioned that I looked like his younger self. I said I wouldn't write it, but here I am writing everything.
I wished I had recorded it all. That thought came to me afterward, and it felt too fast. 
Why did he say that? LOL. Was it a compliment about this milestone chapter? LOLOLOL. 
I find myself lost in such delusions.
A similar thing happened recently at the KTX station. 
A man introduced himself as an Emeritus Professor from 성균관 University, who had experience in the National Intelligence Service. 
His stories were interesting too. He looks at me as.. I thought that if I had prepared better, there would have been many more opportunities for meetings. 
I remembered when I was a high school student, a stranger told me, “Your backlight is like a rainbow.” He wanted to tell me this story when I became a good person.
Should I try to recall those sentences? I should also allocate my time for programmers and teps proverbs, etc.
And today I had a thought I want to travel with healthy girlfriends. 
This think came to me when I watched a YouTube video with the keyword 강인욱 and saw the scene of 장강 양자강.
And I want to write about the feeling in this place. When I arrived, the air felt different, almost like being close to Seoul. 
Today, as I walked around, For a moment, I felt that this air was similar to the air of my hometown..
And I thought yesterday, while I was walking outside, that it’s a good idea for soldiers to walk around with their phones after work.
After that, if I meet a girlfriend, I will ask her, “How much do you lift in the big three?”
The end time is 11:48 PM on the same day.

시작시간은 2024년 9월25일 수요일 오후 10:12.
역시 내가쓰고싶을때 써야 좋아. 어제 내가 외박나갔을때의 사회성에대해 쓰고싶었어, 그러나 시간이지나고, 그 애기를 쓰고싶은 느낌이 사라졌어.
그냥 써보자면..
마침 가장 낮아보이는곳에서 겪었어. 내가 그것에대해 겪고있는중에. 그분이 마중나오며 '사회생활 잘하겠네!잘할거야!'라고 말했어.
그분은 90년대에 육군51사단 군악대 복무를하셨데. 그는 예술인같아보였어 왜냐면 그분 머리를 유추해보건데 연예인 최민수를 닮았고 그 분 앞 술병들을 보면 유추했었지. 
그 애기들 중에 내가 그분 젊었을적을 닮았데. 안쓴다더니 다쓰네. 
녹음할걸이라는 생각이 그일 이후 나올때 생각이 들었어. 이건 너무 빨리 지나갔어. 왜 그분이 그런 단어를 말했을까.ㅋㅋ 이챕터의 지표의 칭찬을 알리는 대화는 아니었을까.ㅋㅋㅋㅋ. 
이런 망상적? 생각하며 놀아. 
최근 ktx에서도 이런 비슷한일이있었는데. 그 자신을 성균관대 명예교수라고 소개하고 국정원에서 일했다고했어. 
그분 애기는 흥미로웠어. 그는 날.. 내 생각에 나만 준비되어있으면 만남의기회가 많을거같다고생각했어. 
그리고 내 고등학교 때 모르는남자가 "네 뒤에가 무지개같다." 고말하고 내가 잘되면 이런일이있었다고 말해달라더라는 기억이나네. 
문장들을 다 복기해볼까.. 난 프로그래머스하고 텝스 속담등에도 시간을 투자해야해.
그리고 오늘 든 생각인데.. 나 건강한여자친구랑 여행가고싶다고생각했어. 이건 내가 강인욱 키워드로 유튜브를 볼때 장강 양자강 장면에서 나온생각이야.
그리고 여기서의 느낌도 나중에 써보고싶어. 내가 여기 도착했을 때 여기 공기는 달랐어 그리고 서울에 가까웠어.
오늘 여기 돌아다니다보니, 난 잠깐 우리동네 공기같다느꼈어. 
그리고 난 어제 밖에 돌아다닐때 생각한건데 병사들도 일과후 밖에 폰들고 돌아다니는것도 좋은 생각이라 생각했어.
난중에 여자친구 생기면 걔한테 3대 몇치냐고나 물어봐야겠다.   
끝난시간은 같은 날 오후 11:48.😊

Later, I will write about my study obsession and why it has strengthened
나중에 내 공부강박이 왜 강화되었는지 써볼려고해.
