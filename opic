4. RESTAURANT
Describe one of your favorite restaurants where you often go to eat. What type of food do they serve there? What do you like about that restaurant?
Rather than the restaurant I usually go to, the one where I had a great meal is Cham Hanwoo Sogalbijip. 
This restaurant stands out to me because I believe their beef is superior to that of other beef restaurants. 
They serve raw beef ribs, marinated beef ribs, and beef rice soup. It's best to order the raw beef ribs there; 
they are more delicious than those at other places.
the end time is 9:28pm.
