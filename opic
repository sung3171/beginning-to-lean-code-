4. RESTAURANT
Describe one of your favorite restaurants where you often go to eat. What type of food do they serve there? What do you like about that restaurant?
Rather than the restaurant I usually go to, the one where I had a great meal is Cham Hanwoo Sogalbijip. 
This restaurant stands out to me because I believe their beef is superior to that of other beef restaurants. 
They serve raw beef ribs, marinated beef ribs, and beef rice soup. It's best to order the raw beef ribs there; 
they are more delicious than those at other places.
the end time is 9:28pm.

Tell me a little bit about yourself and what you do for a living
I’m a student currently studying algorithms to find a job. I’m a third-year college student, but since I’m 31 years old, 
I want to get a job before I graduate. I am also studying English to improve my job prospects. 
I have studied English for a total of about 4 years. I continued to study English steadily while I was in the military. 
Fortunately, I have reached a level where I can find and work on methods to study and express my thoughts in English to some extent.
Even more fortunately, ChatGPT was launched, and I’ve been using it well for studying recently. It really helps me clear up any questions that come to mind. 
Today, I studied algorithms as usual. I reviewed BFS_basics and learned dynamic programming. 
I realized I needed to understand dynamic programming when I revisited the 10th problem on LeetCode, which I had previously thought, "I'll tackle it next time."
I woke up at 8:00 a.m. today and retrieved my phone from the duty officer’s room. 
I spent about an hour chatting with ChatGPT and working on my English. I also managed to squat 90 kg for 15 reps and 5 sets, and bench press 60 kg for 15 reps and 5 sets. 
I think that growth is exciting and enjoyable, much more so than making me forget the pain related to parting.
I want to attain a genuine sense of ease and happiness, where I can smile at any time. 
While I’ve been weak and unable to be completely candid, I’m learning and growing through these experiences.
I'll just write the next thought and cut down my words, hoping that my thinking skills will strengthen and my response time will improve when I face unexpected situations.
I’ve reached a certain level of English proficiency, and now I can see a bit of my future path. 
I want to live with a smile, becoming a relaxed and content person. 
I wonder how it would have been if I had been more relaxed before my military service, since there are so many different people living here.
I feel somewhat disconnected, possibly because I’m not in my 30s yet. 
It seems like I’m alone in a vast ocean. so I can only see distant things from afar. I wonder how things will turn out once I go to university and start working.
I wasted about 20 minutes eating. Recently, I’ve been maintaining my weight around 70 kg.
the end time is 11:02pm.
