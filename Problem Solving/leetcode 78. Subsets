leetcode 78. Subsets


txt = "The binary version of {0} is {0:b}"
print(txt.format(5))
>>> "{0:b}".format(37)
'100101'
>>> x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
>>> f'{x} {y} {2*z}'
'1 2 6'
You can request binary as well:
>>> f'{z:b}'
'11'
Specify the width:
>>> f'{z:8b}'
'      11'
Request zero padding:
f'{z:08b}'
'00000011'
And add common prefix to signify binary number:
>>> f'0b{z:08b}'
'0b00000011'
You can also let Python add the prefix for you but I do not like it so much as the version above because you have to take the prefix into width consideration:
>>> f'{z:#010b}'
'0b00000011'
binary(5)
>>> bin(6)
'0b110'
and when to erase the '0b', I use this:
>>> bin(6)[2:]
'110'

#returns 1 if both bits are 1: else it returns 0. you can check with below
for a in range(16):
    for b in range(a+1,16):
        sum = bin(a + b)
        print(a,b,bin(a)[2:],bin(b)[2:],sum[2:])
        if a & b:
            print('check',bin(a & b)[2:],a & b)

returns 1 if both bits are 1: else it returns 0. at least both bits are 1 you can pass the if condition. 
ex)1100 & 100 = 100(12&4=4), 1010 & 10 = 10(10&2=2), 1011 & 1 = 1, 1011 & 11 = 11 all can pass the if condition. 
1100 & 10 = 0, 1010 & 100 = 0 , 1101 & 10 = 0, 10 & 1 = 0 all can not pass the if condition.
you can check with below

Note: now you understand that the & operator checks whether both bits in the same position are 1. If , at least, both are 1, the result is 1 at that positon.
Else case is all 0, so it can not pass IF condition.
(Numbers. In Python, the integer 0 is always False , while every other number, including negative numbers, are True.)  https://www.learnpython.dev/02-introduction-to-python/090-boolean-logic/10-truthiness/
you can use it mixed with if statment!
