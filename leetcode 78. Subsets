leetcode 78. Subsets


txt = "The binary version of {0} is {0:b}"
print(txt.format(5))
>>> "{0:b}".format(37)
'100101'
>>> x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
>>> f'{x} {y} {2*z}'
'1 2 6'
You can request binary as well:
>>> f'{z:b}'
'11'
Specify the width:
>>> f'{z:8b}'
'      11'
Request zero padding:
f'{z:08b}'
'00000011'
And add common prefix to signify binary number:
>>> f'0b{z:08b}'
'0b00000011'
You can also let Python add the prefix for you but I do not like it so much as the version above because you have to take the prefix into width consideration:
>>> f'{z:#010b}'
'0b00000011'
