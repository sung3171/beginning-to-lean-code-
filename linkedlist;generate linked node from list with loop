#generate nodes in a loop?

I refer below to know linking node from list(or dict) when I were solving 2. Add Two Numbers from leetcode 
like node1; 2->4->3 from l1 = [2,4,3] Likewise l2 = [5,6,4] 
why I'd looked for this trouble. I checked this problems at python complier but it didn't work and I knew above code was needed. 
'''

def make_nodes(n):
    nodes = []
    nodes.append(Node(0,None))    # head node
    for i in range(1, n):
        nodes.append(Node(i, None))
        nodes[i-1].next = nodes[i]    #somehow link them          
    return nodes

nodes = make_nodes()
head = nodes[0]
second = nodes[1]
last = nodes[-1]


nodes = [Node(i) for i in range(n)]
for node in nodes:
    print(node.payload)




#still maintaining... due to this old military computer down. my code flew away.
